# ideas 

- expand the workouts this supports
- create a svelt3 app to consume the api
    - this could have nice features to it for UX
    - experiment with WASM??
- maybe this has user accounts
    - maybe we hash your email address
    - you get an email to login (verify its you)
- maybe it could store changes over time?
- maybe make a nicer template for printing
    - maybe native 4 to page?
    - cleaner layout?
    - a11y thinking?
