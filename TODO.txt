# ideas 

- expand the workouts this supports
    - more 5/3/1 routines (research this)
    - better UI templates. Maybe reimagine this?
- create a svelt3 app to consume the api
    - this could have nice features to it for UX
    - experiment with WASM??
    - generate PDF
- swift app? Maybe for barbell calculator
- maybe this has user accounts
    - maybe we hash your email address
    - you get an email to login (verify its you)
    - track progress?
- maybe it could store changes over time?
    - I'd like to explore this a bit more
- maybe make a nicer template for printing
    - maybe native 4 to page?
    - cleaner layout?
    - a11y thinking?
- tracking statistics
	- this could be useful for seeing lifts over time 
	- this could be useful for gettin old plans


I think it would be nice to use this to wire up stack tracing (maybe AWS xray or something)
